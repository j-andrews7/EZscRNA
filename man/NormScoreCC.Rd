\title{Normalize counts and score cell cycle for each cell}
\usage{
NormScoreCC(scrna)
}
\arguments{
\item{scrna}{Seurat object to score cell cycle genes for each cell.}
}
\value{
Seurat object with cell cycle scores ('S.Score', 'G2M.Score') and 
  'Phase' added to \code{meta.data} for each cell.
}
\description{
\code{NormScoreCC} returns a Seurat object with normalized counts and adds 
cell cycle scores for each gene based on Seurat's cell cycle gene lists.
}
\details{
The Seurat authors state (https://github.com/satijalab/seurat/issues/1679) 
that counts should always be normalized before cell cycle or module scoring.
This is particularly important if one is using the \code{SCTranform} function
for data normalization, scaling, and therefore, regression.
