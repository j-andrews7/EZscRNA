\title{Visualize clonotype distributions}
\usage{
VizVDJDist(scrna, outdir, g_by = NULL, o_by = NULL, n_clono_c = 10,
  n_clono_g = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{scrna}{Seurat object with clonotype data added to metadata with 
\code{AddClonotype}.}

\item{outdir}{Path to output directory.}

\item{g_by}{Metadata column to group samples by. If not provided, only
histograms of clonotypes will be saved.}

\item{o_by}{Vector containing names of members of each group to sort by 
within the group. Ignored if g_by is NULL. Should contain one instance of
each potential value in g_by column if provided.}

\item{n_clono_c}{Number of top clonotypes to plot for comparison barchart.
Default is 10. Ignored if \code(group_by) is NULL.}

\item{n_clono_g}{Number of clonotypes to show in group-specific histograms.
All are shown by default.}
}
\description{
\code{VizVDJDist} visualizes clonotype distributions for each sample in a
seurat object as histograms as well as barcharts comparing clonotype 
proportions between them.
